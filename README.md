# TYPESCRIPT-PROGRAMS
TypeScript for Playwright – Practical Learning
This repository contains small, focused TypeScript programs created while learning
TypeScript for Playwright automation testing.

### What this repo covers:
- Type safety & variables
- Functions & interfaces
- Async/Await (Playwright core)
- Typed test data
- Page Object concepts

Goal: Not just learning concepts, but applying them practically for real-world automation.

#Explanations:
Code 01-variables-and-types.ts
TypeScript enforces type safety
Prevents assigning wrong values (e.g. number to string)
Helps avoid runtime errors in automation scripts

Code02-functions.ts
Function parameters and return types are clearly defined
Makes reusable logic safer and predictable

Code03-interfaces.ts
Interfaces define structure of objects
Prevent missing or incorrect fields

Code04-arrays-and-objects.ts
Strongly typed arrays
Cleaner looping and better IntelliSense

Code05-async-await.ts
TypeScript handles async operations cleanly
async/await avoids callback hell

Code06-test-data-typing.ts
type ensures consistent test data
Avoids runtime failures due to wrong fields

Code07- page-object-example.ts
Demonstrates OOP + TypeScript
Strong typing inside Page Object Model
